        <h3>Aro Valley</h3>
        <p>While romaing around the streets of Aro Valley with my friend, we encountered a frienly feline who was very open to the attention we had to offer. Of the many photographs I have, this is my favourite due to the loving contact she has made with a human, openly accenting the gracious offer of a flower placed upon her head.</p>

        <h3>Brooklyn</h3>
        <p>On the way home from a dog park located within the region of Brooklyn, Sammy was looking out the window rather sad that we were leaving the park to go home. He's a rather affectionate dog, and the cuddliest ball of fluff you will <i>ever</i> meet. </p>

        <h3>Brooklyn</h3>
        <p>At home one day, Sammy was playing with a tennis ball when he lay down on the ground and had his paw out trying to reach the ball. He was tired, yet he still wanted to play with the tennis ball.</p>

        <h3>Aro Valley</h3>
        <p>The cat that my friend and I found in Aro Valley was very friendly, and while I was taking a picture he started walking away- hence this picture. The cat was very sassy in the way he walked and thus made for a great photo oppurtunity.</p>
